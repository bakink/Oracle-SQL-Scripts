REM     Purpose:
REM       We can acquire "Transactions Per Second" (abbr TPS) from the AWR report that locates between 
REM       the begin snapshot and end one, if we wanna look at the "TPS" all of the AWR reports it's 
REM       unnecessary to generate one by one. Hence it's the reason why I wrote this SQL Script.
REM
REM       You know, there saves the value of "user commits" and "user rollbacks" in each of snap_id of 
REM       the view DBA_HIST_SYSSTAT (adding them can get the value of "Transactions") but which is 
REM       from the oracle instance starts up to that snap_id, here we have to use the analytic function 
REM       "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior value of prior snap_id then current vlaue of current snap_id 
REM       subtracts the prior one we can get the real "Transactions" between these two snap_id, then 
REM       "Transactions" divides by the spending time (calculate it by seconds) between the prior snap_id 
REM       and the current snap_id. Ultimately we can get the "tps".
REM
REM       In addition to the begin_interval_time and end_interval_time are in the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT 
REM       we're able to (inner) join the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT and DBA_HIST_SYSSTAT in order to get 
REM       begin_time and end_time of a snap_id.
