REM                    (1) Adding the content of Purpose;
REM                    (2) Rewritten SQL script to the format "WITH ... AS ()" so that more clearly reading and understanding;
REM
REM     Last tested:
REM             11.2.0.4
REM             19.3.0.0
REM             21.3.0.0

REM     Purpose:
REM       We can acquire "DB time" from the AWR report that locates between the begin snapshot and end one,
REM       if we wanna look at the "DB time" all of the AWR reports it's unnecessary to generate one by one.
REM       Hence it's the reason why I wrote this SQL Script.
REM
REM       You know, there saves the value of "DB time" in each of snap_id of the view DBA_HIST_SYS_TIME_MODEL
REM       but which is from the oracle instance starts up to that snap_id, here we have to use the analytic
REM       function "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior value of prior snap_id then current vlaue of current snap_id
REM       subtracts the prior one we can get the real "DB time" between these two snap_id.
REM
REM       In addition to the begin_interval_time and end_interval_time are in the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT we are
REM       able to (inner) join the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT and DBA_HIST_SYS_TIME_MODEL in order to get begin_time
REM       and end_time of a snap_id.
