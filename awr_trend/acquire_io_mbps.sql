REM       Searched out the MoS article "How to Calculate the Number of IOPS and Throughput of a Database (Doc ID 2206831.1)" from Google,
REM       it told us IOPS can be found in different places of the AWR report:
REM         (1) Instance Activity Stats
REM         (2) IO Profile (Starting with 11gR2)
REM         (3) Load Profile
REM
REM       Instance Activity Stats:
REM       Throughput - This is the sum of "Physical read total bytes" and "Physical write total bytes".
REM
REM       IO Profile:
REM       Throughput in Mbps - Total (MB) (This value is the sum of the metrics "Physical read total bytes/sec" and "Physical write total bytes/sec" from the AWR report).
REM
REM       Load Profile:
REM       Please note that the information displayed here is a subset of the one in the IO Profile area:
REM
REM       Load profile      -> Instance Activity Stats
REM       Read IO (MB)      -> physical read bytes
REM       Write IO (MB)     -> physical write bytes

REM     Last tested:
REM             11.2.0.4
REM             19.3.0.0
REM             21.3.0.0

REM  -- Purpose:
REM  --   Typically there saves the value of "physical read total bytes" and "physical write total bytes" in each
REM  --   of snap_id of the view "DBA_HIST_SYSSTAT" (adding them can get the value of "IO Mbytes") but
REM  --   which is from the oracle instance starts up to that snap_id, here we have to use the analytic
REM  --   function "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior value of prior snap_id then current vlaue of current
REM  --   snap_id subtracts the prior one we can get the real "IO Mbytes" between these two snap_id,
REM  --   then "IO Mbytes" divides by the spending time (calculate it by seconds) between the prior
REM  --   snap_id and the current snap_id. Ultimately we can get the "IO Mbps".
REM  -- 
REM  --   In addition to the begin_interval_time and end_interval_time are in the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT
REM  --   we're able to (inner) join the view DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT and DBA_HIST_SYSSTAT in order to get
REM  --   begin_time and end_time of a snap_id.

REM
REM     Purpose:
REM       Typically there saves the average value of "Physical Read Total Bytes Per Sec" and "Physical Write Total Bytes Per Sec"
REM       in each of snap_id of the view "DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_SUMMARY" (in which the value of its column "metric_unit" is
REM       "Physical Read Total Bytes Per Sec" and "Physical Write Total Bytes Per Sec"), here we use the analytic function
REM       "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior snap_id from current snap_id for more clearly showing "IOPS" between these two snap_id.
