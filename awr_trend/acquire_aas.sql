REM     Purpose:
REM       We can get "DB time" based on the acquire_dbtime.sql 
REM       (https://github.com/guestart/Oracle-SQL-Scripts/blob/master/awr_trend/acquire_dbtime.sql),
REM       we can also get "interval seconds" between the current snap_id and the prior snap_id,
REM       so aas (average active sessions) equals "DB time" divided by "interval seconds".
